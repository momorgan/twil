My eyesight got noticably worse last year. I had new lenses made and so I see pretty well with glasses. But without them I couldn’t see the time on my phone.

No washing machine, no fridge, no oven… you forget how fundamental these things are until they’re unavailable. Living on tepid Deliveroos loses its novelty pretty quickly. But good progress on the house is being made.</li><li>In London this weekend.
