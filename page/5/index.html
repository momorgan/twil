I am glad not to have attempted to chose one unsupervised. Whatever I might have chosen would have counted against me. It‚Äôs not that my taste in these things is bad, it‚Äôs that she is looking for something with specific subtleties* that I am only now learning.</li><li>My first sit-at-a-desk job was at a jewellery firm. Mainly, I was writing stock-control software. There was a window of time in the late Nineties there was no viable system capable of indexing such complicated products, let alone ones that can be so heavily customised or remade. So, I picked up a lot of the basics about jewellery. But since then a quarter-century has passed, so these are the things I‚Äôve learned, or had forgotten, about engagement rings:<ul><li>There are thousands of choices, but the vast majority are just small variations on one theme. You‚Äôre in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. The industry has come to depend on offering basically the same ring at thousands of different price-points. Yet, if that‚Äôs not the kind of thing you‚Äôre after, you‚Äôve got to try and find the vanishingly small number of rings that are different but also not horrible.</li><li>It‚Äôs possible to spend simply obscene, <em>offensive</em> amounts of money. Although not on sale, and definitely not to me, I held a ring that would retail for ¬£163,000. If you are making millions and need to get a bunch of your money over an international border without too many questions, then I get it. If you want to make someone feel special, not so much. I was paranoid about dropping it, but for that money I‚Äôd want it it to stop falling a couple of inches off the ground and hover there until I scooped it back up.</li></ul></li><li>Anyway, the search continues. It might be that the stone is found first, and a ring is made for it. Or the ring might already be out there somewhere, waiting patiently in a haystack of wrong rings. I‚Äôm happy either way; no rush.</li><li>Like everyone else, I‚Äôve been fiddling with ChatGPT. I love it when it is willfully disobedient, such as when you give it a word-count to stick to and it not only ignores it, it insists it has done as commanded. The illusion of disobedience is an interesting evolution of the Turing test that I didn‚Äôt see coming.</li><li>Stunningly, tragically true: <a href="https://medium.com/@markc6820/the-lifecycle-of-advertising-agencies-f9495f1fd6ef">The Lifecycle of An Advertising Agency</a>.</li></ul><hr><p>*What an amazing word subtleties is. Having typed the above, I found myself staring at it. Such a funny-looking word, subtleties. Subtleties. Look at the state of it. I defy you not to say sub-tul-ties. Or subt-let-ees. Anyway.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0014/">Weeknote 0014</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-07T18:00">7 April 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>I asked her to marry me, and she said yes!</li><li>There‚Äôs a bit more texture to that: I asked her to consider it and she didn‚Äôt have to answer straight away. But she more-or-less did, having stipulated that she would not wear a big white dress. Call me old-fashioned, but I‚Äôd far prefer she wore lots of outfits of her choosing throughout the course of the marriage; each one different from the one the day before. And whichever one she chooses for the first day, I‚Äôm okay with it.</li><li>This took place over a lovely lunch at <a href="https://www.takumi.uk/birmingham">Takumi</a> in Birmingham, where we enjoyed the finest fare since we were in Japan.</li><li>With institution comes legacy. Marriage comes with a whole bunch of patriarchal bullshit. So in the coming months will be thought and effort to weed all that out and define how it‚Äôll be fit for us.</li><li>This weeknote will be slightly delayed in posting, as there are still some people that we‚Äôd rather tell face-to-face. This is supposed to be ‚Äúthis week, I learned‚Äù, not ‚Äúthis week, you found out‚Äù üòÜ</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Had a couple of positive work moments, all of which have offered surprised and learning opportunities. One client has all sorts of considerations upon their decision-making, and the courteous thing to do in those instances is present a choice between a safe approach and a more radical one. And would you believe it, they went radical. It‚Äôs great when they feel the confidence. Another client asked for a couple of specific proposals, both of which point to some interesting and impactful outcomes. And a third client agreed to some proposed outcomes, if not the process to get there, so that‚Äôs pretty close.</li><li>I‚Äôve been doing a ton of research into workplace ED&amp;I: specifically, how to allow people to think about inclusion as more than just getting a better mix of genders and skintones sitting at desks. I learned the term ‚Äòwellness-washing‚Äô to describe the kinds of short-termist approaches to inclusion that lead to tokenism and fruitbowls. I also learned the term ‚Äòfrozen middle‚Äô, whereby insufficient focus is placed upon giving those with marginalised identities the experience necessary for them to advance, or the power to influence change. Plus I codified my thoughts around psychological safety which, it turns out, has much more research around it than I anticipated.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>It‚Äôs going to be a while until the bass comes back. As I‚Äôm asking Andy to fit a drop-D tuning mechanism to a short-scale bass, he has views about what strings it‚Äôll need and has asked me to source a custom set. They‚Äôd take two weeks to make before Andy can continue the set-up, and the specification process was far from straightforward. So against his advice I‚Äôve asked for an off-the-peg set. If it‚Äôs dreadful, I‚Äôll look into it again.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0013/">Weeknote 0013</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-03-31T18:00">31 March 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>My Mac came back. Hardware issue fixed but, annoyingly, they took it upon themselves to wipe the thing and reinstall the OS. How that helps with a blown speaker I do not know. Recovering a 2TB volume is a long and tedious series of niggles.</li><li>My back has been hurting for a few days, so went to the fancy hotel in town for a massage. A lovely use of an hour on a Sunday afternoon but, sadly, didn‚Äôt do the trick.</li><li>By coincidence, we also took delivery of a new mattress. God, I wish we‚Äôd done so sooner. A new mattress is always keen to point out how bad the old one was.</li><li>Succession is back. Love it. Lots of good TV going on right now: The Last of Us, Ted Lasso, Taskmaster and The Mandalorian. Also a new Wes Anderson film is coming up in a couple of months, which I expect I will love.</li><li>I realised I had a spare phone, identical to my dying Pixel 3 but with a cracked screen and missing power button. The battery, though, is still sound. I didn‚Äôt fancy Frankensteining the two together, but then it hit me: I could just remap the buttons and put up with the good-battery bad-screen combo for a few months.</li><li>During the week, almost nothing else happened apart from work and a trip to the local McDonalds for a McPlant and fries. It‚Äôs been that kind of week.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>I took my bass to Andy the local luthier. He has been booked near-solidly since I bought it in January. I assumed he might have been dealing with a Covid-induced backlog but, it turns out, the lockdown kept him busier than ever. With everyone staying in, folks went up into their lofts and dug out their neglected guitars so that they could follow lessons on YouTube. So he has never been busier, and is making his way through piles of guitars needing his attention.</li><li>Instrument-makers are my kind of people. It‚Äôs the kind of pursuit that is part science, part art and, candidly, part blind faith. The first 90% of any service is procedural, but the magic happens in the final 10%. But there‚Äôs no real way of knowing how much time or effort will be needed to find that magic, so I have no sense of when I‚Äôll get my bass back. It‚Äôs going to be measured in weeks, but then you can measure any period of time in weeks.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/6/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/4/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
