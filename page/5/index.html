We went to place with a couple of bowling alleys and some interactive dartboards. It’s been some years since I rolled a bowling ball, and I can’t help going full Big Lebowski with it. Typically my first ball down the alley flukes a strike, and then I’ll spend the rest of the time failing to replicate that. It’s the kind of thing I’d probably be much better at if I went every week, like everything else.</li><li>I lectured again, this time for the start-up accelerator the Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, at which I’ve also been in a previous cohort. I wrote the 90-min session a year ago: it’s a bit of a slog but it’s the shortest amount of time I can possibly take to give a non-brand person the insight and skills to be able to develop one themselves. I also found I needed to do some subtle rewrites: since I constructed the thing I’ve found my thinking has moved on a little in some areas. I now find the balance of content tipping away from customer insights and into areas such as sector truths and working culture. Not because customers are important, but because start-ups are already thinking about them. What they often miss, as many businesses do, are the shared objectives and enemies of their sector peer-group, that they needn’t reinvent. As a small business it’s far more efficient, with only a few exceptional cases, to let market leaders do all the work to educate customers about the sector. Anyway. Will likely do another in the summer, by which point I’ll likely disagree with myself again.</li><li>Quite a lot of snow fell, over several days. It’s been unusually cold for the time of year.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/11/2023-03-09-09.00.40.jpeg" alt="Snow in the garden" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/11/responsive/2023-03-09-09.00.40-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/11/responsive/2023-03-09-09.00.40-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/11/responsive/2023-03-09-09.00.40-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Partially because of the weather, it’s been a quiet, head-down kind of week.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0009/">Weeknote 0009</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-03-03T18:00">3 March 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Difficult week, this one. And difficult to write about, too. This is one of those occasions when working in the open is incompatible with things that are not for public consumption. So this weeknote’s a little light.</li><li>Went to the dentist on Saturday, for two fillings. Pretty traumatic. It takes a lot of focus for me to manage something like that. Following all that, I’ve had pretty bad toothache all week, which I’m hoping might just calm down in due course. I’ll give it another week or so.</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7036295587410931713/">James did a brave thing</a> by straight-up sharing his mental health situation on LinkedIn. Chronic mental conditions (or indeed any condition) are heavily stigmatised, particularly in low- to mid-quality workplaces. From my own experience with bipolar and epilepsy, I know how hard it is to talk about. No, specifically, to get to the point where you feel like you can talk about it. It’s easy to talk about it. I’m talking about it now. But for years I didn’t, and I regret that. Let nobody who comes after us go through that. Let’s hear them boring on about their mental health until it’s so normalised that people are universally as sympathetic and supportive as when you graze your knee.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>My little pedal set-up is making it easier to hear what I’m not getting right yet. Before, the tone knob and pickup switch didn’t do a great deal. But with a proper preamp it’s more balanced. I can now go from deep, blunt tones right up to bright and jangly ones. The latter is good for hearing all the bad fretting technique. I’m at a point where my technique is not universally bad. It’s unevenly bad: some fingers are weaker than others, and some frets aren’t falling precisely under them. It’s great to be able to hear that by tweaking the preamp to be as unforgiving as it gets.</li><li>I’ve managed to book the bass in to see a luthier at the end of this month, for a proper set-up. Now I’ve come to live with it a while, it’s clearly not in terrible shape. But it could use a pro’s skills and experience to set the string height and fix the intonation. I probably could do that basic stuff if I did my research, but a proper experienced guitar tech will get better results more quickly.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/6/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/4/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
