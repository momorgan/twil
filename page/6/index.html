Perhaps I was seduced by the <a href="https://youtu.be/a_zQiRDXXDc">Rightmove</a> ad: soft, twinkling sunlight streaming in as soft, twinkling piano music plays on. But I certainly wasn’t prepared for the reality of post-pandemic house sales. It affected me more than I expected.</li><li>Elderly folks who might have already benefitted from moving, then imprisoned in their homes for months at a time and possibly even cut down by the virus. House after house, exactly as they were left. Families trying to untangle the affairs of their parents or grandparents while still shouldering their loss. Clothes still hanging in wardrobes. Keepsakes still where they were placed. School photos of grinning grandchildren still proudly in their frames. Once-tidy lawns and vegetable patches now muddy and unkempt. Walking sticks still propped up by bedside tables.</li></ul></li><li>The nice things about hybrid working is enjoying going to the office in person, even if for me it’s a substantial trip. In the new routine, the cost of going in is about the same as my salary for the time I’m there. And I also get much less done there, which means having to catch up. But the non-domestic social contact is good. It’s worth it for intellectual nourishment.</li><li>I used to travel a lot for work, which meant getting as familar with certain airports as I was with my own office. When that’s the role, you get used to the rhythm and cadence of it. Eventually you start to recognise familar faces, presumably doing similar jobs, perhaps for competitors. There’s a certain smile reserved for folks at a gate waiting to board: an acknowledgement of both a shared experience and a social boundary that ought not be blurred. I wonder where those folks are now. Perhaps still riding the travelators.</li><li>I have to manage some of my family relationships carefully, as some relations emit stress the way cats emit fur. This week was shedding season.</li><li>Did some research and thinking around the process by which we make career choices. It’s interesting how many people get a say in the decisions we make about work. It’s also noteworthy that many of our career ‘choices’ aren’t really choices. There’s no option 2. I’ve been researching this to explore ways in which those decisions can be more rounded, with a bit of neutral input from outside. It’s a tightrope between saying things you’d alrteady thought of, and saying things that feel undesirable or inapplicable or downright remote.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><ul><li>Learning your first (western) instrument is harder than learning subsequent (western) instruments as you have to wade through a bunch of music theory. Even though I don’t love the piano I am at least grateful to have first sat at one aged four. There’s probably. better place than the piano stool to learn the theory of octaves and intervals and whatnot. It’s all graspable on strings but a keyboard is much more visual. I’ve got that image in my head as I now fumble around finding those same notes on the fretboard.</li><li>I can now play Where the Streets Have No Name. Deceptively complex for a new player. You’ve got to master those those chugging 8th-notes faster than you might expect, while also finding four notes across two strings. Not bad for two weeks. I’ve been playing along with Spotify, using a bit of crude EQ to stand in for Adam Clayton. If they do go ahead with this rumoured Vegas residency, I’m sure he won’t mind.</li><li>U2 are unfashionable now; their massive, sustained popularity combined with Bonzo’s synonymity with humanitarianism that often comes over as virtue-signalling puts them in a league of music-press hatred they share with only Coldplay. There is no place for U2 or R.E.M. on Bowie-centric 6Music for example, which is a shame. I like a lot of U2’s work down the years, even the stuff U2 fans don’t like. This is not the golden era of stadium rock, but it wasn’t so long ago that a weekend TV schedule dominated by talent shows and ballroom dancing seemed very much of the past.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="meta">Meta</h3><ul><li>I’m using <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a> to put out these notes; so far, so good. It’s not without its challenges: it works fine on my Intel Mac but not my Silicon one, and there’s no way to compile and publish the site from my iPad or phone. But the same would be true of Jekyll and I preferred an app over running Ruby at the command line. Ruby has never come intuitively to me, so all my experiences with it have been a fight, not a flow.</li><li>At some point it’d be nice to get into the weeds of building a robust site template for <a href="https://doing.digital">doing.digital</a> to be usable in Publii or Jekyll or Eleventy or something, so I can migrate it off Wordpress. Or I might just kill it. Even while setting up that site—even before pressing ‘buy now’ on the hosting plan—I knew I’d regret using Wordpress. But I’d also prefer not to compile locally on the command line, since it ties me to (more or less) one machine that I don’t take everywhere. Even Publii is guilty of this. So maybe <a href="https://www.microfeed.org/">Microfeed</a> is the next thing to explore.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0002/">Weeknote 0002</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-01-13T18:00">13 January 2023</time></div></header><p>A thought about weeknotes, why they’d be valuable for agencies and yet why they’ll never adopt them, follows below.</p><p>So I’ve been doing a bunch of research in recent weeks into the automotive market and its aspirations to move from product manufacture to service provider.</p><ul><li>And these days CES is a car show. Almost all manufacturers are augmenting their tin boxes with digital services of some kind. But I’ve noticed two things.</li><li>First, all the initial predictions (circa 2015 or so) about connected vehicles predicted growing demand at a rate that never materialised.</li><li>Second, the considerable majority of those who have adopted them think the experience is bad.</li><li>The big consultancies that made all these big predictions don’t mention how off they were, but are now preaching that the future of automotive <em>depends</em> on selling subscriptions rather than tin boxes.</li><li>It still seems like a blinkered view of how automotive, or perhaps mobility, will move onwards. It’s as if everyone’s trying to solve problems that aren’t problems. Does anyone even want a self-driving car? Driving the thing is the good bit. I can’t imagine why someone would buy, insure, park and maintain a car and then hand off the driving to a computer. Seems entirely backwards. Anyway.</li></ul><p>Onto other things.</p><ul><li>I’ve also been doing some brand essence and positioning work again. Nice to be deep in the details of something like this. There are always many thorny contradictions through which to work.</li><li>Watched <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">Get Back</a></em> again. Glyn Johns is staggeringly glamourous all the time. Be more Glyn Johns.</li><li>I love <a href="https://mo.social/@mo">Mastodon</a>. Running my own instance is the right setup for me, but with the drawback that the federated timeline was blank. Then I discovered the <a href="https://relay.fedi.buzz/">FediBuzz Relay</a> as a means of synthesising the buzz of a thumping great instance.</li><li>I have this nagging, malformed theory that Elon Musk might be the world’s greatest philanthropist: he’s used his fortune to cripple a toxic, abusable, politically-destablising and unregulated platform while there’s still time. Although he also keeps stacking up contradictory evidence. But maybe, I dunno, he’s bluffing?</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><ul><li>I’ve been practicing on my new bass daily. I think you get further by practicing little and often, as opposed to a heads-down cram on a Sunday. I’ve been following the lessons that work has sponsored. It all starts with technique exercises. Feels less unnatural every day.</li><li>I can sort of roughly play Sweet Home Alabama to a recognisable standard. It’s the archetypal beginners’ bass lick: straightforward plucking pattern, not too many notes and plenty of time between the notes to move around the fretboard while that is not yet instinctive. Nice shootin’, Tex!</li></ul><hr><h3 id="why-agencies-dont-do-weeknotes">Why agencies don’t do weeknotes</h3><p>Adland/digital/product agency people are not in the habit of keeping weeknotes. You might think it’d be a useful convention to introduce. But, I can tell you categorically that you should not waste an iota of consciousness or effort trying to do this: it’ll never, ever work.</p><p>Agencies talk of innovation and ideas and creativity and the future, but are starkly conservative. That leads them to sell talent by the metre as opposed to by the value it could bring: it’s a model so flawed that, like democracy, it’s a frustration there’s nothing better that could be implemented in its place. Well, there <em>are</em> other models that would work in theory, but it never, ever, <em>ever</em> works for real because clients simply won’t buy it. The only way clients will agree to buy agency talent is by the metre, and that is the fundamental cause of agency conservatism.</p><p>All that leads to one thing: timesheets. The gold, what little there is, is in them there timesheets. In every agency I’ve ever worked, there is a near-constant collective monologue about job codes, traffic management and timesheets. This reaches a head at the end of the week, as timesheets need to be put in. Typically, this administrative task enters the pre-frontal cortex on Friday at about 4pm, and then begins the labourious task of trying to reconsile whatever it was you did over the last five days.</p><p>Timesheets are weirdly taxing because they demand a fidelity of recall that doesn’t suit the way we remember things. Our memories are connected to the feelings we had. It’s easier to recall how you felt about something than what you did about something. This is what makes human memory so fallable. Change the feeling: change the memory.</p><p>Anyway, that’s the crux of why agency people don’t keep weeknotes: it’s the switch of mental mode. Timesheets demand a mode of logical guesswork that requires us to suppress all thoughts of what went well, what we learned, what was fun or how valuable something was. Then mode-switching back to emotional recall is just as mentally expensive. So, agencies will never, ever keep weeknotes. Even if there were some internal drive for it, it wouldn’t stick. Unless someone could construct an AI that you could feed emotional memory in the form of weeknotes and it could map the effort or value back to the billings. Hashtag free idea.</p><p>This all ladders up to the power imbalance between agencies and clients, as almost everything about agencies ultimately does. Clients aren’t at <em>fault</em>, but they do have the casting vote in any decision. It means there’s a constant downward pressure on price while general fannying about on both sides increases the cost of service. The squeeze in the middle causes the enthusiasm for reconsiling working hours regardless of value. Perversely, if clients <em>insisted</em> on receiving weeknotes like they do for financial transparency, they’d benefit enormously. It would encourage the agency to balance its collective attention between the money charged and the value returned. Anyway, won’t happen, don’t even try.</p><p>Perhaps to disprove all this, I like putting in my timesheets. It keeps me honest. The cruelty is that the <em>work</em> gets done largely outside the periods of time in which my timesheets record. All too often I’ll spend an unhealthy proportion of the ‘working’ day staring blankly at a problem or fiddling in the margins. Then at 4am I’ll wake with a solid idea. Then I’ll have to reach for the laptop to capture it, trying to make up the time lost fannying around during the day before the idea sailed in.</p><p>I’m careful to make my timesheets <em>accurate</em>, but there’s accuracy and then there’s accuracy. They could not feasibly reflect both the fannying-around time and the real, valuable work because it was impossible to predict where and when the lightning would strike when whatever project was costed up. I’d love there to be a line-item in the proposal for ‘fiddling around writing fairly unsatisfying bullet points on a PowerPoint chart while waiting for the magic to happen’. But clients wouldn’t buy that level of honesty either.</p><p>If this were a snappy LinkedIn post, this last bit would be a rallying cry for rethinking the model. But I’ve not put this here with any expectation it’ll change. Rather, by recording it, I never have to think about it again.</p></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/7/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/5/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
