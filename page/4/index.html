Managed to do some research, drafted a few slides, and went down a rabbit-hole in psychology.</li><li>Succession concluded. I’m so glad I got into that show early on. It had all the makings of a Mad Men-esque tragedy and it didn’t disappoint. It’s interesting to me how the conclusion subtly rewrote my understanding of the whole thing. I decided to rewatch it with the end in mind - not so much ‘what’s going to happen?’ but ‘what might have gone differently?’ Of course, that’s what’s been going on in the writers’ room these last five years.</li><li>Okay so, Japan. Travelled down to Heathrow on Thursday evening, stayed in an airport hotel which wasn’t as bad as I’d imagined: still the better option than flying from my local airport and changing at a different hub.</li><li>Got into the air on Friday morning, in the direction of a transfer at Hong Kong. Aeroplane Wi-Fi makes sense on journeys at this distance and the coverage and pricing are better than I remember.</li><li>Arrived late into HKG, so the airline had already put down seats on a later flight. HKG itself was more of a faff than I expected, and there was no lounge availability for a bit of comfort. Mercifully, the back of the plane was fairly empty, so I could catch a couple of hours’ kip. Even so, I arrived at Narita as a carbon-based life-form devoid of a body-clock.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0021/">Weeknote 0021</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-26T18:00">26 May 2023</time></div></header><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/22/2-185.jpeg" alt="It&#39;s a photo of Mo, giggling" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/22/responsive/2-185-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/22/responsive/2-185-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/22/responsive/2-185-md.jpeg 768w"></figure><p></p><ul><li>Recently we held a couple of filming days for <a href="https://hellolumino.com/">Lumino</a> and I showed up for one of them, mostly for the free food. <a href="https://www.amytakesphotos.co.uk/about-me/">Amy</a> is an extraordinary photographer and was in attendance. She took many great pictures, of which this is one. I’m giggling at something <a href="https://www.jesslove.com/">Jess</a> is saying. What a great team we have.</li><li>One of the embuggerances of home rental is the things you’re contractually-obliged to do are usually completely unsupported by the landlord.<ul><li>I’m required to keep the garden in good order. But no tools are provided to maintain it, nor is anywhere to store any of my own, plus the same lease forbids putting up a shed.</li><li>I have to cut the grass, even though there’s no mower and no bin for the council to collect the cuttings, and no way of composting them. So neither easy nor rewarding. Not a lawn; just an uneven patch of clumpy yellowing grass and thistles.</li><li>So, my ever-supportive mother-in-law dutifully comes round to drop off her mower, strimmer and rake. She then returns once the grass is cut to collect the tools and, bless her, black bags of cuttings to put in her own green waste bin. Not all heroes wear capes.</li><li>Imagine my horror as my mother-in-law’s electric strimmer, that she had lent and even brought round out of the goodness of her heart, caught fire. Briefly I considered attempting to repair it but, as the blue smoke creeped out of its little electric motor, I thought I’d give it a minute. I used that minute to check the price of a replacing it, and ordering a replacement. Would she notice the difference? Well yes, because I bought a better one. A German one.</li></ul></li><li>Moths have arrived. Many, many moths. Millie is slowly but violently dispatching them.</li><li>Lovely week, weather-wise. I spent half of it in Bristol. Best bowl of noodles I’ve ever had in the UK. This is a teachable moment: if someone suggests a meal, let them order first and then say ‘same again, please’.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0020/">Weeknote 0020</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-19T18:00">19 May 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Eurovision was last weekend.<ul><li>I’ve always liked Eurovision, both in execution and in concept. Many people seemed unhappy with the result, but isn’t it wonderful to see so many people enjoying and feeling a passion for a single event.</li><li>Livetweeting Eurovision used to be a fun thing, up until probably about five years ago. Livetooting on <a href="https://mo.social/@mo">Mastodon</a> recaptures some of that. I also learned a lot more about administering an instance from the more technical perspective. My little instance was slowing down ingesting toots from other instances, to the point where ‘new’ tweets were posted about 20 minutes ago. I probably wouldn’t have noticed unless Eurovision was on. Everyone seemed to be talking about the song three countries back. Anyway, feels like a good thing to understand that better.</li></ul></li><li>I bought a big suitcase—easily the biggest I’ve ever bought—ahead of going away soon.<ul><li>I’m not going to tell you when, in case you try and break into my house and steal my stuff. Fortunately, the case is big enough to take all my stuff with me, plus myself and a few of my friends. It’s so big that I’m worried the Just Stop Oil protestors will lie down in front of it.</li><li>Anyway, I am going away next month and I can’t wait.</li></ul></li><li>I had a pitch win, and it’s important to take a moment to enjoy that before starting the work. Almost immediately I started working on preparing for another pitch.</li><li>For years, I’ve been bouncing around from one email solution to the next. But I’m finding <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> to be better than anything else I’ve tried, and I regret not moving to there sooner. I was seduced by the spam-control of Gmail, then Gsuite, then seduced again by hydro-powered servers running in privacy-focussed juristictions. I’ve tried all sorts of filtering and management solutions that sit on top. But it turns out all I really need is a system that eventually deletes boring emails.</li><li>I love fig rolls. They’ve been hard to get hold of on Brexit Island. I like them so much that my birthday present was a wholesale batch-load of Brexit-defeating fig rolls. Presumably they were smuggled in, or something. Perhaps that created demand because fig rolls were back on the shelves this week. And now they’re in my belly.</li><li>New Zelda is out and consuming a lot of time in this household. It’s not a leap forward, like the last one, but it is certainly a refinement.</li><li>Some of the most valuable things I’ve ever learned came straight out of <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/never-split-the-difference-negotiating-as-if-your-life-depended-on-it-chris-voss/3692653">Never Split the Difference</a> by Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator. The thing I keep coming back to is simply that negotiation isn’t about beating someone. Negotiation is making sure everyone feels that they won.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>I’ve been waking up too early so practicing the bass first thing. It’s good discipline but it sure as hell gives me day-long earworms. And that’s on top of all the Eurovision earworms.</li><li>Technique still patchy. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, not sure what is behind one or the other.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/5/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/3/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
