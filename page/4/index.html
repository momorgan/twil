One of those kinds of gifts you give to someone where you get to go too. Really good. A half-hour in dead-pan conversation with Fiona Lindsay, followed by questions from the audience. Her style has such a quick and seemingly effortless nature that it’s reminiscent of street magic.</li><li>Bayer (yeah, you know, that thumping-great consumer health org) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bayer_bayer-uki-g4a-programme-announces-their-first-activity-7054048071915053056-QnNo">announced</a> its partnership with <a href="https://hellolumino.com">Lumino</a>, the start-up I co-founded. So that’s nice. This has been embargoed for a while, which has the effect of making the magnitude of it creep up on me from time to time. So I alternate between casual mention and holy <em>shit</em>. Anyway, onwards. ✊ Better mental health for <em>everyone</em>.</li><li>Oh, and it’s my birthday. When I turned 40, I was writing a little newsletter and so took one edition to record <a href="https://github.com/momorgan/lifesmanylessons">40 lessons from 40 years</a>.<ul><li>These things are often worded as if they’re advice to others but, as the first lesson states, people giving you free advice are talking to themselves. So this is me talking to myself about successes I want to build upon and mistakes I needn’t repeat.</li><li>I put a <em>lot</em> of thought into them; nearly all are backed by at least three data-points. At the time, I thought maybe I’d pick up one more each year and the list would continue to grow with me. In fact, each of these do not represent one year, but long-running themes.</li><li>Meanwhile, all the points remain largely true. They were not written in any kind of priority order, but what’s happening over time is that their relative importance is changing. The one that jumps off the page as proving evermore valuable is to <em>“talk about mental health as often as you might about physical health”</em>. The one that jumps off the page because I have struggled is the fourth: <em>“cut out cancerous people quickly, actively seek out better ones”</em>.</li><li>Maybe in a few years I might be able to capture a couple more. There’s certainly one currently on the boil concerning sacrifice in the name of principles. This is not an original thought, but a value isn’t a value unless it costs you something. Bill Bernbach phrased it as <em>“More and more I have come to the conclusion that a principle isn’t a principle until it costs you money”</em>. And there are social and emotional costs too. So you can expect to see that in my list of 50.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>The bass is back! Andy the luthier finally made it through his backlog and did me a full setup. The E string now also has a machine head with a lever that drops it to a D, which on a short-scale bass is quite a fun and angry thing. The drop in string tension makes it more inclined to rattle the frets, which through the fuzz/overdrive pedals sounds incredible.</li></ul><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/17/2023-04-20-21.38.46-1.jpg" alt="Machine heads in situ" width="2902" height="2178" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/17/responsive/2023-04-20-21.38.46-1-xs.jpg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/17/responsive/2023-04-20-21.38.46-1-sm.jpg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/17/responsive/2023-04-20-21.38.46-1-md.jpg 768w"></figure><p></p><ul><li>I need to get back into regular practice. Five bursts a week seems to be optimal.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0015/">Weeknote 0015</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-14T18:00">14 April 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Over Easter we began looking at engagement rings. I am glad not to have attempted to chose one unsupervised. Whatever I might have chosen would have counted against me. It’s not that my taste in these things is bad, it’s that she is looking for something with specific subtleties* that I am only now learning.</li><li>My first sit-at-a-desk job was at a jewellery firm. Mainly, I was writing stock-control software. There was a window of time in the late Nineties there was no viable system capable of indexing such complicated products, let alone ones that can be so heavily customised or remade. So, I picked up a lot of the basics about jewellery. But since then a quarter-century has passed, so these are the things I’ve learned, or had forgotten, about engagement rings:<ul><li>There are thousands of choices, but the vast majority are just small variations on one theme. You’re in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. The industry has come to depend on offering basically the same ring at thousands of different price-points. Yet, if that’s not the kind of thing you’re after, you’ve got to try and find the vanishingly small number of rings that are different but also not horrible.</li><li>It’s possible to spend simply obscene, <em>offensive</em> amounts of money. Although not on sale, and definitely not to me, I held a ring that would retail for £163,000. If you are making millions and need to get a bunch of your money over an international border without too many questions, then I get it. If you want to make someone feel special, not so much. I was paranoid about dropping it, but for that money I’d want it it to stop falling a couple of inches off the ground and hover there until I scooped it back up.</li></ul></li><li>Anyway, the search continues. It might be that the stone is found first, and a ring is made for it. Or the ring might already be out there somewhere, waiting patiently in a haystack of wrong rings. I’m happy either way; no rush.</li><li>Like everyone else, I’ve been fiddling with ChatGPT. I love it when it is willfully disobedient, such as when you give it a word-count to stick to and it not only ignores it, it insists it has done as commanded. The illusion of disobedience is an interesting evolution of the Turing test that I didn’t see coming.</li><li>Stunningly, tragically true: <a href="https://medium.com/@markc6820/the-lifecycle-of-advertising-agencies-f9495f1fd6ef">The Lifecycle of An Advertising Agency</a>.</li></ul><hr><p>*What an amazing word subtleties is. Having typed the above, I found myself staring at it. Such a funny-looking word, subtleties. Subtleties. Look at the state of it. I defy you not to say sub-tul-ties. Or subt-let-ees. Anyway.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0014/">Weeknote 0014</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-07T18:00">7 April 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>I asked her to marry me, and she said yes!</li><li>There’s a bit more texture to that: I asked her to consider it and she didn’t have to answer straight away. But she more-or-less did, having stipulated that she would not wear a big white dress. Call me old-fashioned, but I’d far prefer she wore lots of outfits of her choosing throughout the course of the marriage; each one different from the one the day before. And whichever one she chooses for the first day, I’m okay with it.</li><li>This took place over a lovely lunch at <a href="https://www.takumi.uk/birmingham">Takumi</a> in Birmingham, where we enjoyed the finest fare since we were in Japan.</li><li>With institution comes legacy. Marriage comes with a whole bunch of patriarchal bullshit. So in the coming months will be thought and effort to weed all that out and define how it’ll be fit for us.</li><li>This weeknote will be slightly delayed in posting, as there are still some people that we’d rather tell face-to-face. This is supposed to be “this week, I learned”, not “this week, you found out” 😆</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Had a couple of positive work moments, all of which have offered surprised and learning opportunities. One client has all sorts of considerations upon their decision-making, and the courteous thing to do in those instances is present a choice between a safe approach and a more radical one. And would you believe it, they went radical. It’s great when they feel the confidence. Another client asked for a couple of specific proposals, both of which point to some interesting and impactful outcomes. And a third client agreed to some proposed outcomes, if not the process to get there, so that’s pretty close.</li><li>I’ve been doing a ton of research into workplace ED&amp;I: specifically, how to allow people to think about inclusion as more than just getting a better mix of genders and skintones sitting at desks. I learned the term ‘wellness-washing’ to describe the kinds of short-termist approaches to inclusion that lead to tokenism and fruitbowls. I also learned the term ‘frozen middle’, whereby insufficient focus is placed upon giving those with marginalised identities the experience necessary for them to advance, or the power to influence change. Plus I codified my thoughts around psychological safety which, it turns out, has much more research around it than I anticipated.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>It’s going to be a while until the bass comes back. As I’m asking Andy to fit a drop-D tuning mechanism to a short-scale bass, he has views about what strings it’ll need and has asked me to source a custom set. They’d take two weeks to make before Andy can continue the set-up, and the specification process was far from straightforward. So against his advice I’ve asked for an off-the-peg set. If it’s dreadful, I’ll look into it again.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/5/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/3/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
