My next home will be one I own. It took a long, long time to get here.</li><li>This bit makes people’s eyebrows shoot up: I didn’t see it before buying it. The first time I visited was five days after I owned it. It’s important in life to find people whose opinion you can trust. This has been an exercise in precisely that.</li><li>The bones are good. Everything else needs attention. The first job is to figure out exactly what needs doing to bring an old building up to a modern standard of living.</li><li>Plus, a new city. I’ve worked in Bristol for a year, but in the way we now work in places: I’ve swung by from time to time. So more accurately, I’ve worked <em>out of</em> Bristol. And now I have to properly learn my way around.</li><li>This is a tab I’ve had open for a couple of weeks: The <a href="https://lib.edist.ro/library/anonymous-beginners-guide-to-spray-paint-vandalism">Beginners’ Guide to Spray Paint Vandalism</a>.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0027/">Weeknote 0027</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-07-07T18:00">7 July 2023</time></div></header><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/28/soundburger.jpeg" alt="Audio Technica Sound Burger reissue" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/28/responsive/soundburger-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/28/responsive/soundburger-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/28/responsive/soundburger-md.jpeg 768w"></figure><p></p><ul><li>Delighted to have gotten hold of a newly-reintroduced <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/at-sb727">Sound Burger</a> turntable.<ul><li>I’ve wanted one of these <em>forever</em>, decades maybe, but wasn’t quite brave enough to take on a well-loved second-hander. It’s small enough to sit on my desk so I can put albums on as I work. I had a portable turntable there already—one of those ones DJs use when cratediving—but it was noisy and not really hi-fi enough to listen to at close range.</li><li>Audio-Technica made a limited run for their anniversary and were pleased enough with the demand to put the Sound Burger back into production. It’s taken months and months, but this is why we all need tools that routinely check web-pages for updates (like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/update-scanner/">this one</a> for Firefox).</li><li>For now, I have one case stuffed mostly with old jazz records and a few other favourites. Most of my vinyl is still in crates waiting to be taken from the current (temporary) digs to the next (permanent) home, where they will enjoy pride of place. Which leads me onto…</li></ul></li><li>Now within one last step of owning that permanent home. As in, it could happen within days. I was starting to feel I’d be a tenant for ever. Turns out all I needed to do was leave my home town and go somewhere I could be a gentrifier, not gentrifiee. Do I feel good about that? Not particularly. Am I looking forward to leaving shitty tenantsville limbo? Absolutely.</li><li>Work stuff has been busy this week; probably will be next week too.<ul><li>Stuff got done at both extremes. At the extroverted, social end: orchestrating research workshops. At the the introverted, reflective end: the torture of hunting for ideas. Sometimes they appear quickly, but you still have to keep looking in case you’ve just fallen for the first one you found. So I find having an idea really means finding 10-15 ideas and whittling them down, while being careful not to blend them into a grey average.</li><li>Work that involves sitting comfortably takes more recuperation than the rest.</li></ul></li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0026/">Weeknote 0026</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-30T18:00">30 June 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Apart from in college and an ill-judgement during a lockdown, I’ve never bothered trying to be clean-shaven. Another lockdown ill-judgement was to try and grow a ‘proper’ beard, but the two sides of my face are yet to reach an agreement about whether it should be curly or dead straight. Attempt abandoned. These days, the grey hairs are more resistant to trimming than the others. My cat has white whiskers from her brown cheeks: I wonder if I would end up the same.</li><li>Another episode of The Grand Tour turned up on Amazon Prime, which I half-watched. It’s essentially based on the road-trip segment of the Top Gear format. But somehow its lost all its production values. The good camera work, the good edits, the good grading, all discarded. It looks like YouTubers made it, which makes me wonder why it’s still worth showing.</li><li>Lovely London lunch with a friend I’d not seen since the beforetimes. Covid prevented get-togethers for a while, but asynchronous communications continued. So it kind-of doesn’t <em>feel</em> like so much time has passed. I’m losing track of who I’m losing track of.</li></ul><h3 id="van-notes">Van notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo builds a campervan]</em></p><ul><li>Post MOT, work continues. The big learning from this project, now in its third year, is how seemingly minor things cause massive delays. Getting stuff painted before assembly can in some cases result in weeks of waiting. If it were a full-time project and nothing else were happening, it’d be fine. But fitting painting coats around real life, while the other jobs stack up behind, can start to feel very static. Then occasionally there’s a huge leap forwards in the space of four hours.</li><li>Next, I have to figure out how to build the lightest possible kitchen.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/3/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
