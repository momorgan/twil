Almost all manufacturers are augmenting their tin boxes with digital services of some kind. But I’ve noticed two things.</li><li>First, all the initial predictions (circa 2015 or so) about connected vehicles predicted growing demand at a rate that never materialised.</li><li>Second, the considerable majority of those who have adopted them think the experience is bad.</li><li>The big consultancies that made all these big predictions don’t mention how off they were, but are now preaching that the future of automotive <em>depends</em> on selling subscriptions rather than tin boxes.</li><li>It still seems like a blinkered view of how automotive, or perhaps mobility, will move onwards. It’s as if everyone’s trying to solve problems that aren’t problems. Does anyone even want a self-driving car? Driving the thing is the good bit. I can’t imagine why someone would buy, insure, park and maintain a car and then hand off the driving to a computer. Seems entirely backwards. Anyway.</li></ul><p>Onto other things.</p><ul><li>I’ve also been doing some brand essence and positioning work again. Nice to be deep in the details of something like this. There are always many thorny contradictions through which to work.</li><li>Watched <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">Get Back</a></em> again. Glyn Johns is staggeringly glamourous all the time. Be more Glyn Johns.</li><li>I love <a href="https://mo.social/@mo">Mastodon</a>. Running my own instance is the right setup for me, but with the drawback that the federated timeline was blank. Then I discovered the <a href="https://relay.fedi.buzz/">FediBuzz Relay</a> as a means of synthesising the buzz of a thumping great instance.</li><li>I have this nagging, malformed theory that Elon Musk might be the world’s greatest philanthropist: he’s used his fortune to cripple a toxic, abusable, politically-destablising and unregulated platform while there’s still time. Although he also keeps stacking up contradictory evidence. But maybe, I dunno, he’s bluffing?</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><ul><li>I’ve been practicing on my new bass daily. I think you get further by practicing little and often, as opposed to a heads-down cram on a Sunday. I’ve been following the lessons that work has sponsored. It all starts with technique exercises. Feels less unnatural every day.</li><li>I can sort of roughly play Sweet Home Alabama to a recognisable standard. It’s the archetypal beginners’ bass lick: straightforward plucking pattern, not too many notes and plenty of time between the notes to move around the fretboard while that is not yet instinctive. Nice shootin’, Tex!</li></ul><hr><h3 id="why-agencies-dont-do-weeknotes">Why agencies don’t do weeknotes</h3><p>Adland/digital/product agency people are not in the habit of keeping weeknotes. You might think it’d be a useful convention to introduce. But, I can tell you categorically that you should not waste an iota of consciousness or effort trying to do this: it’ll never, ever work.</p><p>Agencies talk of innovation and ideas and creativity and the future, but are starkly conservative. That leads them to sell talent by the metre as opposed to by the value it could bring: it’s a model so flawed that, like democracy, it’s a frustration there’s nothing better that could be implemented in its place. Well, there <em>are</em> other models that would work in theory, but it never, ever, <em>ever</em> works for real because clients simply won’t buy it. The only way clients will agree to buy agency talent is by the metre, and that is the fundamental cause of agency conservatism.</p><p>All that leads to one thing: timesheets. The gold, what little there is, is in them there timesheets. In every agency I’ve ever worked, there is a near-constant collective monologue about job codes, traffic management and timesheets. This reaches a head at the end of the week, as timesheets need to be put in. Typically, this administrative task enters the pre-frontal cortex on Friday at about 4pm, and then begins the labourious task of trying to reconsile whatever it was you did over the last five days.</p><p>Timesheets are weirdly taxing because they demand a fidelity of recall that doesn’t suit the way we remember things. Our memories are connected to the feelings we had. It’s easier to recall how you felt about something than what you did about something. This is what makes human memory so fallable. Change the feeling: change the memory.</p><p>Anyway, that’s the crux of why agency people don’t keep weeknotes: it’s the switch of mental mode. Timesheets demand a mode of logical guesswork that requires us to suppress all thoughts of what went well, what we learned, what was fun or how valuable something was. Then mode-switching back to emotional recall is just as mentally expensive. So, agencies will never, ever keep weeknotes. Even if there were some internal drive for it, it wouldn’t stick. Unless someone could construct an AI that you could feed emotional memory in the form of weeknotes and it could map the effort or value back to the billings. Hashtag free idea.</p><p>This all ladders up to the power imbalance between agencies and clients, as almost everything about agencies ultimately does. Clients aren’t at <em>fault</em>, but they do have the casting vote in any decision. It means there’s a constant downward pressure on price while general fannying about on both sides increases the cost of service. The squeeze in the middle causes the enthusiasm for reconsiling working hours regardless of value. Perversely, if clients <em>insisted</em> on receiving weeknotes like they do for financial transparency, they’d benefit enormously. It would encourage the agency to balance its collective attention between the money charged and the value returned. Anyway, won’t happen, don’t even try.</p><p>Perhaps to disprove all this, I like putting in my timesheets. It keeps me honest. The cruelty is that the <em>work</em> gets done largely outside the periods of time in which my timesheets record. All too often I’ll spend an unhealthy proportion of the ‘working’ day staring blankly at a problem or fiddling in the margins. Then at 4am I’ll wake with a solid idea. Then I’ll have to reach for the laptop to capture it, trying to make up the time lost fannying around during the day before the idea sailed in.</p><p>I’m careful to make my timesheets <em>accurate</em>, but there’s accuracy and then there’s accuracy. They could not feasibly reflect both the fannying-around time and the real, valuable work because it was impossible to predict where and when the lightning would strike when whatever project was costed up. I’d love there to be a line-item in the proposal for ‘fiddling around writing fairly unsatisfying bullet points on a PowerPoint chart while waiting for the magic to happen’. But clients wouldn’t buy that level of honesty either.</p><p>If this were a snappy LinkedIn post, this last bit would be a rallying cry for rethinking the model. But I’ve not put this here with any expectation it’ll change. Rather, by recording it, I never have to think about it again.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0001/">Weeknote 0001</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-01-06T18:00">6 January 2023</time></div></header><p>Hey. It’s <a href="https://momorgan.com/">me</a>. Hope you’re well. A longer introduction to this little site will follow below. For wider context, I also wrote about <a href="/2022-yearnote/">my 2022</a>.</p><hr><ul><li>Returned from a nice break in Bilbao and San Sebastian. The dead-zone between Christmas and New Year is one of my favourite times to travel: it makes a conscious something out of an unconscious nothing. It also encourages careful thought about where to go, as typical holiday destinations are set up for summer trade. But many places make for a worthwhile visit anytime.</li><li>The trip was dented by illness in the group, but nobody was going to miss out on the Guggenheim: a building more impactful than a few of the works it houses. It’s as if some highly-capable artists set out to explore spaces, perhaps to fight off their kenophobia, and then Frank Gehry had a ‘hold my beer’ moment.</li><li>Received a few hand-crafted Christmas cards: that’s something I should do next time, perhaps.</li><li>There are train strikes. Many train strikes. I fully support striking workers, but I’m also aware how privileged a position that is. If I had the kind of job that required me to somewhere specific every day, it’d be painful. Even so, I expect the strikes will continue and catch me on the days I do need to be somewhere. But people should be paid fairly.</li><li>Otherwise, work was a relaxed and easy start to the year, apart from one particularly exciting but heavily confidential handful-of-minutes meeting: I mark it here just for my own benefit.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p>I bought a bass guitar! The build-up to this has been long. 20 years ago I was in a garage band, occupying the role of bassist but playing temperamental, thunderous analogue synths. Eventually we each headed off into four different kinds of adulthood, but then last June they tracked me down and we started putting some songs together remotely. I’ve been recording the old bass parts using various soft-synths and guitar emulators, while also writing new ones on, of all things, my ukulele.</p><p>I bought my first uke ten years ago and found it <em>much</em> harder than people say (I’m mostly left-handed but decided to play right-handed after many years of embuggerance from other left-handed instruments). When I started to be… not terrible… I bought a lovely tenor uke and it sits by my desk so that I pick it up often. It proved easier to write bass parts for songs written on guitars using a stringed instrument, so that became the process. Then three months ago I decided if I could find a practical bass, I’d buy it and learn how to play it. Eventually I did, and so I am.</p><p>Work has some kind of ‘passon project’ budget per head, so they’ve chipped for a beginners’ bass guitar course. So gimme nine months and I’ll be playing Seven Nation Army or whatever.</p><hr><h3 id="a-longer-introduction-than-i-intended">A longer introduction than I intended</h3><p>In some form or another, I’ve been diarising for years. In 1999, I started posting to my site every day using a handmade content-management system. It was blogging by an early, loose definition; probably now you’d call it public journalling or something.</p><p>Eventually a public diary stopped being a good idea: as the web’s population grew I found myself needing to censor more, which increased the drag. I packed it in after six years or so. Revisited it a couple of times but by then social media was in full swing, so having some random little diary didn’t have its original social benefits. Lesson learned.</p><p>More recently I ran a <a href="https://blast.red">newsletter</a> for three years: something I’d wanted to commit some effort to for a while. The newsletter was strictly not about me and things I was up to, but I wrote a couple about mental health from a personal perspective, as well as some others that were inspired by wherever I was that week. I can see why people try and monetise their newsletters, although that was never of much interest to me. Recipients had many kind things to say about it, but it takes substantial time and effort to put together a weekly newsletter of any quality. Again, lesson learned.</p><p>So after that, I fired up a new blog, <a href="https://doing.digital">doing.digital</a>, focussing specifically on digital-era human behaviours. Thinking about this stuff is basically my day-job and so the blog has a formal-ish style. Not quite right for rough notes and underbaked reflections. But I always enjoyed the discipline of getting stuff down on a regular schedule, which led me to firing up this little site so I can record and publish some <a href="https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html">weeknotes</a> of sorts.</p><p>There’s a couple of weeknote conventions I’ll have to bend. Weeknotes are method of team communication, usually with a known audience. One of my work environments hasn’t adopted this open style and I don’t want to wait in vein for that kind of change to come about. I’ve wasted too much of my life waiting for these kinds of shifts when I should’ve just cracked on. So I’m using the rough format just to structure some early-definition blog posts.</p><p>Second, there are plenty of things I do in my week that shouldn’t be public, for reasons I’m sure are the same in everyone’s jobs and life. There will be omissions and obfuscations—perhaps enough just to remind me what it was, but not enough for anyone else—and leave it at that.</p></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/3/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
