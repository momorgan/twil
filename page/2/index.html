In its place are two plywood panels to tidy up the pillars: they were among the first things to be made, but many steps were necessary before they could be permanently fitted. They’ve also needed a recent repaint. The one behind the driver’s seat is wider as the kitchen will be immediately behind.</li><li>With the panels now permanently installed and with the back and the middle of the van almost complete, the gap between gives a sense of the scale of the kitchen.</li></ul></li><li>Holiday planning is underway for our next trip to Japan next month. A couple of the less obvious destinations I’m very excited about.</li><li>Other than that, just a short week of work. Good meetings though. My first trip to Nottingham, which is a nice city centre.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>A change in the band. Our exceptional drummer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ciaradrums/">Ciara</a> has many plates spinning at the moment and is stepping back. So Andi and I are considering what to do with ourselves: perhaps something edgier and more electronic. I spent a good while thinking whether to park all the existing material and start afresh, or whether to continue but change production styles. I think it’ll end up as a combination, across different projects.</li><li>So, I’ve been messing about on the bass, trying new combinations of pedal sounds. I picked up a second-hand <a href="https://www.ehx.com/products/bass-soul-food/">EHX Bass Soul Food</a> overdrive, which is a glorious-sounding thing given what I paid for it. I also rejigged the order of the pedals on the board so that I can push the <a href="https://orangeamps.com/products/fx-pedals/kongpressor/">Kongpressor</a> really hard. I don’t think I’ve got it sounding exactly right yet, but it’s in there somewhere.</li><li>Having enjoyed a proper set-up, <a href="https://www.gretschguitars.com/gear/build/bass/g2220-electromatic-junior-jet-bass-ii-short-scale/2514730517">my little bass</a> has a glorious jangle to it, and it has reintroduced me to its very highest notes. With the <a href="https://www.t-rex-effects.com/quint-machine">T-Rex Quint Machine</a>, it’s fierce Deep Purple power-chords all the way.</li><li>Many of the bass parts for the band I wrote for and played on synths, so I’m going back and re-learning them on the bass. I’m pleased I asked Andy the luthier to fit the <a href="https://hipshotproducts.com/collections/bass-xtenders/products/gb7-bass-xtender">Hipshot Xtender</a> to the E string: I’d not realised how much I rely upon the D below.</li><li>My technique is still mucky and I’m not that quick around that frets, but it’s coming along slowly.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0017/">Weeknote 0017</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-28T18:00">28 April 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>The feeling of making progress seems to operate independently of progress itself. This is something of which I remind myself when working on the campervan conversion. Even though progress is happening all the time, it feels as if only sometimes there’s a step forward.</li><li>In the middle of the van, there’ll be an upholstered bench either side. Both lift up to reveal… (more about that another time). They’ve been designed to be as light as possible. The downside is they’re not standalone, like regular furniture: they can’t be sat upon until the’re completely installed.</li><li>This weekend I cleared most of the tasks that need to be done before the benches can be finished off, which feels like progress even though most of it is just fiddling about.</li><li>Related: sometimes slide decks come together easily, other times it’s a real struggle. This week I’ve been flip-flopping between <em>three</em> presentations that are all proving difficult to write.</li><li>Sunday night is a good time for a crime thriller, but not necessarily outside your own house. Drugs proliferate here. After a while you can recognise it everywhere, the way you might spot mail being delivered. Tatty, non-descript hatchbacks are commonly used, and one tore past while we were watching TV. Unfortunately for them, our road is a 180m dead end. Police cars piled in behind. One person was quickly detained, while officers went door-to-door and dogs went garden-to-garden presumably looking for another. All very lively for a school night. I hate it here.</li><li>A good day filming for <a href="https://hellolumino.com">Lumino</a> today. We have such a great community of talented and committed people, and I feel lucky every day. I said some vaguely coherent things on video, and looked gormless in stills. All in a day’s play.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/3/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
