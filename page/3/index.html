She took many great pictures, of which this is one. I’m giggling at something <a href="https://www.jesslove.com/">Jess</a> is saying. What a great team we have.</li><li>One of the embuggerances of home rental is the things you’re contractually-obliged to do are usually completely unsupported by the landlord.<ul><li>I’m required to keep the garden in good order. But no tools are provided to maintain it, nor is anywhere to store any of my own, plus the same lease forbids putting up a shed.</li><li>I have to cut the grass, even though there’s no mower and no bin for the council to collect the cuttings, and no way of composting them. So neither easy nor rewarding. Not a lawn; just an uneven patch of clumpy yellowing grass and thistles.</li><li>So, my ever-supportive mother-in-law dutifully comes round to drop off her mower, strimmer and rake. She then returns once the grass is cut to collect the tools and, bless her, black bags of cuttings to put in her own green waste bin. Not all heroes wear capes.</li><li>Imagine my horror as my mother-in-law’s electric strimmer, that she had lent and even brought round out of the goodness of her heart, caught fire. Briefly I considered attempting to repair it but, as the blue smoke creeped out of its little electric motor, I thought I’d give it a minute. I used that minute to check the price of a replacing it, and ordering a replacement. Would she notice the difference? Well yes, because I bought a better one. A German one.</li></ul></li><li>Moths have arrived. Many, many moths. Millie is slowly but violently dispatching them.</li><li>Lovely week, weather-wise. I spent half of it in Bristol. Best bowl of noodles I’ve ever had in the UK. This is a teachable moment: if someone suggests a meal, let them order first and then say ‘same again, please’.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0020/">Weeknote 0020</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-19T18:00">19 May 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Eurovision was last weekend.<ul><li>I’ve always liked Eurovision, both in execution and in concept. Many people seemed unhappy with the result, but isn’t it wonderful to see so many people enjoying and feeling a passion for a single event.</li><li>Livetweeting Eurovision used to be a fun thing, up until probably about five years ago. Livetooting on <a href="https://mo.social/@mo">Mastodon</a> recaptures some of that. I also learned a lot more about administering an instance from the more technical perspective. My little instance was slowing down ingesting toots from other instances, to the point where ‘new’ tweets were posted about 20 minutes ago. I probably wouldn’t have noticed unless Eurovision was on. Everyone seemed to be talking about the song three countries back. Anyway, feels like a good thing to understand that better.</li></ul></li><li>I bought a big suitcase—easily the biggest I’ve ever bought—ahead of going away soon.<ul><li>I’m not going to tell you when, in case you try and break into my house and steal my stuff. Fortunately, the case is big enough to take all my stuff with me, plus myself and a few of my friends. It’s so big that I’m worried the Just Stop Oil protestors will lie down in front of it.</li><li>Anyway, I am going away next month and I can’t wait.</li></ul></li><li>I had a pitch win, and it’s important to take a moment to enjoy that before starting the work. Almost immediately I started working on preparing for another pitch.</li><li>For years, I’ve been bouncing around from one email solution to the next. But I’m finding <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> to be better than anything else I’ve tried, and I regret not moving to there sooner. I was seduced by the spam-control of Gmail, then Gsuite, then seduced again by hydro-powered servers running in privacy-focussed juristictions. I’ve tried all sorts of filtering and management solutions that sit on top. But it turns out all I really need is a system that eventually deletes boring emails.</li><li>I love fig rolls. They’ve been hard to get hold of on Brexit Island. I like them so much that my birthday present was a wholesale batch-load of Brexit-defeating fig rolls. Presumably they were smuggled in, or something. Perhaps that created demand because fig rolls were back on the shelves this week. And now they’re in my belly.</li><li>New Zelda is out and consuming a lot of time in this household. It’s not a leap forward, like the last one, but it is certainly a refinement.</li><li>Some of the most valuable things I’ve ever learned came straight out of <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/never-split-the-difference-negotiating-as-if-your-life-depended-on-it-chris-voss/3692653">Never Split the Difference</a> by Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator. The thing I keep coming back to is simply that negotiation isn’t about beating someone. Negotiation is making sure everyone feels that they won.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>I’ve been waking up too early so practicing the bass first thing. It’s good discipline but it sure as hell gives me day-long earworms. And that’s on top of all the Eurovision earworms.</li><li>Technique still patchy. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, not sure what is behind one or the other.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0019/">Weeknote 0019</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-12T18:00">12 May 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>The esteemed Phil Gyford, Esq. <a href="https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2023/04/28/blogroll-keepers-9/">wrote something nice about these weeknotes</a>: frankly I had no idea anyone—least of all him—was reading.<ul><li>Even though we’ve moved in the same circles for over two decades, I’ve met Phil (I think) only once. My epilepsy brain loses memories for extended periods but this one resurfaced recently. It was at the Conway Hall: London’s very own museum of uncomfortable seating. He’d made the mistake of standing in the foyer in plain view, and I collared him. Who is this guy, he must have thought, and why is he strangersplaining all the cool stuff I’ve made back to me? He was gracious.</li><li>Phil has made many excellent things, including the <a href="https://ooh.directory/">Ooh! Directory</a> of old-school blogs. The one I’d submitted dies this week, because the hosting company has make an unreasonable price increase and I’ve been too disorganised to move it away in time. Plus, I opted for WordPress, which I feared would be a mistake. Surely it can’t still be as bad as it used to be, I thought. But, of course, it is. So doing.digital will come back, all flat-file like this one is, although probably not using Publii either. I do like Publii but it’s quite common for me not to be at the machine upon which it’s installed, and it won’t install on any other device in my care.</li><li>I initially missed this because Panelbear, which I used to gather a hit-count on this and other sites, was killed off at the end of last month to try and migrate to whatever bloated, overpriced thing took it over. So I did migrate, but to another nice simple, low-cost one. I then forgot the name of it. Fortunately a lovely someone spotted Mr Gyford’s kind words and emailed me about it. And <em>that’s</em> why we internet.</li></ul></li><li>I bought a jetwash and I regret waiting until middle-age to do it.<ul><li>Young people are under so much pressure to be young. And while they should make mistakes and travel and try stuff and savour the moment, they should also buy a jetwash.</li><li>Mine is bristling with toys. The paving around this horrible rented house has never looked better. Having cleaned it and then brushed coarse sand between the blocks, it’s a higher-standard job than our lousy landlord really deserves: he who still hasn’t replaced the fence panels that blew away two winters ago.</li></ul></li><li>I’ve been ill this week. It’s probably the commonest of colds or perhaps a mild fever, but since Covid even the most minor things seem to wipe me out. So I’ve spent a few days sweating and being rubbish at Mariokart. Have you played Mariokart online? It’s a great way to remind yourself, no matter how good you think you are, that you can’t beat an international swarm of tweens*.</li></ul><p><sub><em>* I saw International Swarm of Tweens at Glastonbury once, before they were mainstream. Their earlier stuff was better.</em></sub></p></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/4/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/2/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
