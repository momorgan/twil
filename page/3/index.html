The first thing that’s striking is the traffic: there are road signals and markings, but herds of cars submerged in swarms of mopeds pay little attention. The next striking thing is the humidity, and the third is the wealth inequality. I felt conspicuous.</li><li>My sense is that Vietnam gets nicer the further from the cities you travel. Maybe I should have had a go at that 20 years ago. Still, it’s interesting to spend a day in a different city. Walked around some of the most famous sights. At the historic post office, three recent graduates stopped me for a conversation to practice their English. Sweet kids. I said some things that were on my mind about privilege.</li><li>Then took to the observation floor of the incongruous Bitexco Financial tower as the sun went down. Strange city, this. Both highly functional and deeply broken. I feel like almost everyone is being held down, somehow.</li><li>I fared better on the 12-hour flight back to Heathrow than I had on the way out via Hong Kong. I find the jetlag easier westward; I might even have slept a bit on the plane. When you’ve spent time somewhere like Japan, the amateurishness of Heathrow is stark; it took an age to disembark. Then a series of train-rides home; all seeming a bit half-arsed after the Shinkansen.</li><li>Two weeks is the amount of time I need to break from work. It takes ten days for my brain to stop trying to solve work problems, and the full fortnight for me to forget whatever it is I do. So I returned to my desk feeling fresher than I can remember.</li><li>Had the great pleasure of lecturing again for the Accelerate programme at the Judge Business School. I do a hot 90 on DIY brand-building for the benefit of startups and young ventures. I’d rejigged the deck slightly since the last time through, to take out the bits that always seem to drag. I might have cut too deep: it’s now a little ranty. But hopefully useful to people. I always get nice feedback from folks, so I hope they can make use of it all. And it keeps me sharp.</li><li>Instructed a solicitor to put together a will, which felt grown-up. I’m going to put in an annual reminder to update it. This first version is a functional answer to “what are we supposed to do with all Mo’s stupid stuff?”. Over the course of the coming year, I’d like to think more deeply about important people and what they might find sentimental, useful or funny to inherit.</li><li>Took the van in for MOT. I have found one of life’s great necessities: <a href="https://www.martekmotorservices.co.uk/">a honest garage</a>. I have used them for three years and I intend to keep returning no matter where I am living. This year the van sailed through, which I suppose means the work they did last year has held up. I should really buy a car, too.</li><li>Went to see Wes Anderson’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230388/">Asteroid City</a>; a film that’ll surely polarise. Many movies (maybe most) put their themes, characters and memorable moments into dialogue. Here, I sense Anderson is showing a story rather than telling it, and that will certainly polarise audiences. Loved it.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0024/">Weeknote 0024</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-16T18:00">16 June 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Still in Japan. Next stop: Kanazawa.</li><li>Japanese hotels, I’m finding, don’t have wardrobes. They have a rail, parallel to one wall, with four coathangers. Travelling with about a weeks’ worth of evermore crumpled clothing, I’d love to let the air get at it. My t-shirts still smell like aeroplane fuselage. I spuriously packed shampoo; next time, I’m bringing a clothesrail.</li><li>It’s also proving hard to ‘go out for dinner’. There’s not much in the way of casual dining, unless you count casual drinking, and restaurants tend to be booked up. Fallen foul of that a couple of times. Need to make a point of eating at lunch, quite early. I’ll get the hang of it.</li><li>One restaurant I was pleased to find and book into was the exceptional and plant-based <a href="https://www.loveforall-kanazawa.com/menu-en">Love For All</a>. That name, reminiscent of the hempcloth-and-dreadlock dross in Camden, belies its superior dining experience. Fanciest things I’ve eaten for a while. Lovely.</li><li>It’s very rare that I find a hat that fits. But as the top half of my face was quite red, it was worth another go. And wouldn’t you know, two showed up at once in the camping consession I was passing in some department store into which I’d wandered. So I guess I’m a hat guy now.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/kanazawa.jpeg" alt="Kenroku-en garden, Kanazawa" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/kanazawa-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/kanazawa-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/kanazawa-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Took in Kanazawa’s star attractions: Kenroku-en garden followed the castle park. Like every other ancient building, it has stood there for hundreds of years while having also been built within the last 20. There’s a refreshing honesty to the Japanese approach of maintaining, restoring or just rebuilding these treasures once they’ve fallen over or most often burned down. A building remains, despite having been entirely rebuilt ten times.</li><li>Another marvellous Shinkansen, covering 365 miles (roughly London to Edinburgh) in four hours.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/hiroshima-2.jpeg" alt="Peace dome, Hiroshima" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/hiroshima-2-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/hiroshima-2-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/hiroshima-2-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Hiroshima station has two stamps. One depicts the peace gardens, the other features okonomiyaki, a griddled savoury pancake with ingredients including Worcestershire sauce. It seems right not to cram these ideas into one. There’s the Hiroshima forever reeling from the horror of the A-bomb that killed 140,000 people. Then there’s the bustling Hiroshima that stands today.</li><li>Arrived in the middle of the flower festival. Roads closed; stalls and people everywhere. The city’s name carries such sombre baggage, so it was stunning to arrive into such vibrancy. A highlight was a community samba band, thumping loudly across the Peace Park. Peace, it seems, needn’t be peaceful.</li><li>The displays in the Peace Memorial Museum uses the most direct language. It is a stark place and I admit there were some sections where I couldn’t linger. One sentence has stuck with me: “nuclear weapons and humankind cannot coexist indefinitely”.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/miyajima.jpeg" alt="Miyajima" width="1200" height="513" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/miyajima-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/miyajima-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/miyajima-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Took a tourist boat out to the island of Miyajima, known for its large Torii arch standing in a shallow bay. The place is teetering, but still just on the right side of, the line between rural community and being overrun by tourism. There is no Hilton, yet, but there’s also barely a shop that isn’t all souvenirs. It was very hot.</li><li>Happened upon a good CaliMex place. I’m comfortable not eating Japanese quisine every day.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/osaka.jpeg" alt="Osaka" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/osaka-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/osaka-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/osaka-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Onward to Osaka, somewhere I’d been keen to revisit. Had a really good time here. Immediately went up to the large red ferris-wheel on top of the HEP Five department store. Other highlights included a long time accumulating more stationery at Itoya, excellent sushi at <a href="http://en.kantaro-hakodate.com/">Kantaro</a>, Pokemon and Nintendo stores, and a hotel both with a proper clothes-rail <em>and</em> (on request) an additional ten hangers! It’s the little things.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/supernintendoworld.jpeg" alt="Super Nintendo World" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/supernintendoworld-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/supernintendoworld-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/25/responsive/supernintendoworld-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>A whole day spent at Universal Studios Japan. It must be at least 30 years since I went to a theme park, but Super Nintendo World seemed too good to miss. And it was certainly the highlight: the Mariokart ride, a mix of high-tech trickery and augmented reality.</li><li>That’s this week’s Japanthology. Join me next week for the trip home including a sneaky layover.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0023/">Weeknote 0023</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-09T18:00">9 June 2023</time></div></header><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/ueno.jpeg" alt="Busy alley in Ueno" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/ueno-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/ueno-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/ueno-md.jpeg 768w"></figure><p></p><ul><li>It’s a travel-writing cliché to call somewhere a place of contrasts, so let’s get that out of the way. Tokyo is a place of contrasts, didn’t you know? It has a rich history and tradition, cheek-by-jowl with modernity. There, that’s done. The same also applies to Nikko, Matsumoto, Kanazawa, Osaka, and Saigon, plus everywhere I have or will be passing through in between. The slight variation on this is Hiroshima: still a contrast, but between peril and peace. But more on that next week.<ul><li>I’m resisting writing a day-by-day travelogue. It’d be as boring as listening to someone recount a dream. But then, I tend to forget the specifics of my travels. So this time, I carried a small notebook as a journal, and I’ll pull out just the learnings for the weeknotes. A contrast, then, between tradition and modernity.</li><li>I last visited Japan in 2019 when I was feeling pretty low. Despite that, I loved it and wanted to return in better spirits. This time around, I planned to spend less time in Tokyo and more in Osaka, along with some new places along the way. During my last visit, I had covered Kyoto, Nara, and Koyasan, so this time I wanted to explore more widely. However, it was difficult to decide on which places to leave out.</li></ul></li><li>Time spent in Tokyo was dedicated to ticking off some of the things I hadn’t had time for previously, such as visiting the National Museum. However, I also revisited the Tamiya store, on behalf of my eight-year-old self, and Loft in search of stationery. God, I love Japanese stationery. I was particularly keen to hit the Hightide store as I already have a lot of stuff from them, but it’s amazingly expensive in the UK.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/shibuya.jpeg" alt="Lights of Shibuya" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/shibuya-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/shibuya-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/shibuya-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Tokyo’s Metropolitan Government Building is one hell of a statement. Its presence exudes strength, its light and immaculate interior suggest attention to detail, while its free-to-enter observation floor speaks to openness and civic pride. You get the sense that Tokyo, from a local government perspective, is keen to show off itself.</li><li>Headed up to Nikko, which, as a world heritage site, had a lot of promise. Stayed in a lovely hotel, but the shrines have fallen victim to their own notoriety. It was mobbed. Nikko the town is sleepy, perhaps not fully recovering from Covid interrupting the flow of tourists. Nearby, I’d found a peculiar and near-deserted <a href="https://www.tobuws.co.jp/en/">theme park</a> of sorts containing 1:25-scale models of famous buildings. Not just Tokyo’s famous towers but also those of Manhattan and many others you’d recognise. It straddled the line between glorious and terrible. I had low expectations but came away fond of the weird little place.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/pyramid.jpeg" alt="Tobu World Square" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/pyramid-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/pyramid-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/pyramid-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Many (most?) Japanese railway stations have their own ink stamp: collecting them is a thing, and that piqued my interest. They’re often not easy to find, which gives a sense of achievement. Each has a design relevant to the station or its locality. My journal started becoming a mix of notes and stamps.</li><li>Matsumoto came as a surprise. It has slivers of a more boho culture than I expected: little stores and coffee bars lining the street that leads from the station to its Museum of Art. Here, a collection of works from Yayoi Kusama, the city’s most famous daughter, is proudly displayed. It was delightfully a quiet and relaxed venue for the artist’s own collection that she’d decided to display not in New York or Tokyo, but in the more modest place of her birth.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/kurobe.jpeg" alt="Kurobe Dam" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/kurobe-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/kurobe-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/kurobe-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li><li>Somehow, while planning the trip, I’d discovered what’s known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tateyama_Kurobe_Alpine_Route">Alpine Route</a>: a charming series of interconnected transport through the Hida mountains.<ul><li>It’s usually worthwhile pursuing any outing that includes a cable-car or ropeway. I’ve applied this thinking across four continents. It works.</li><li>The Alpine Route is not widely marketed to international tourists and so it took some work to find out about it and make bookings. I think I started by using Google Earth to figure it all out, which wasn’t easy since some of it is underground.</li><li>Much of the route was built in the late 1950s to construct the Kurobe Dam, walking over which forms part of the route. Heading south-east to north-west, a local bus takes visitors to the start of a 6km underground electric bus route that reaches the dam itself. On the other side, an underground funicular, a ropeway, and an underground trolleybus bring tourists to the snow-capped top. Then a highland coach, another funicular, and a quirky Wes-Anderson-esque train come down the other side.</li><li>I’m so glad I found it; it was a memorable and relaxing day of surprisingly easy tourism. The laziest way to cross a mountain range.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/alpine_route.jpeg" alt="Alpine Route" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/alpine_route-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/alpine_route-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/24/responsive/alpine_route-md.jpeg 768w"></figure></li></ul></li><li>More of this next carry-on week. Such wide travels in a short time are possible thanks to the Shinkansen: the planet’s finest high-speed railway network. The thing that always strikes me is how unremarkable it is to travel this way, except when you look out at the scenery screaming past at 180mph. The Shinkansen is so quick and effortless between cities that it makes all other transport feel pedestrian. A marvel.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/4/" class="btn">Previous </a><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/2/" class="btn">Next</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
