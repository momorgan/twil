Hardware issue fixed but, annoyingly, they took it upon themselves to wipe the thing and reinstall the OS. How that helps with a blown speaker I do not know. Recovering a 2TB volume is a long and tedious series of niggles.</li><li>My back has been hurting for a few days, so went to the fancy hotel in town for a massage. A lovely use of an hour on a Sunday afternoon but, sadly, didn’t do the trick.</li><li>By coincidence, we also took delivery of a new mattress. God, I wish we’d done so sooner. A new mattress is always keen to point out how bad the old one was.</li><li>Succession is back. Love it. Lots of good TV going on right now: The Last of Us, Ted Lasso, Taskmaster and The Mandalorian. Also a new Wes Anderson film is coming up in a couple of months, which I expect I will love.</li><li>I realised I had a spare phone, identical to my dying Pixel 3 but with a cracked screen and missing power button. The battery, though, is still sound. I didn’t fancy Frankensteining the two together, but then it hit me: I could just remap the buttons and put up with the good-battery bad-screen combo for a few months.</li><li>During the week, almost nothing else happened apart from work and a trip to the local McDonalds for a McPlant and fries. It’s been that kind of week.</li></ul><h3 id="bass-notes">Bass notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo learns the bass guitar]</em></p><ul><li>I took my bass to Andy the local luthier. He has been booked near-solidly since I bought it in January. I assumed he might have been dealing with a Covid-induced backlog but, it turns out, the lockdown kept him busier than ever. With everyone staying in, folks went up into their lofts and dug out their neglected guitars so that they could follow lessons on YouTube. So he has never been busier, and is making his way through piles of guitars needing his attention.</li><li>Instrument-makers are my kind of people. It’s the kind of pursuit that is part science, part art and, candidly, part blind faith. The first 90% of any service is procedural, but the magic happens in the final 10%. But there’s no real way of knowing how much time or effort will be needed to find that magic, so I have no sense of when I’ll get my bass back. It’s going to be measured in weeks, but then you can measure any period of time in weeks.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0012/">Weeknote 0012</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-03-24T18:00">24 March 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>My phone is limping along now. No longer supported by its maker and with a seemingly unreplaceable battery, it is obsolescence in the palm of my hand. But it’s hard to bring myself to change it.<ul><li>I stumped up for a decent spec and I’ve been pretty happy with it. Good screen, great camera, more than enough storage and I’ve never found anything it isn’t powerful enough to do.</li><li>The main thing wrong with it is the limited service you get from the manufacturer. If it can be supported for three years, it could be supported for ten. And constantly-good battery, i.e. swapping them over if need be, would be more valuable to me than runtime between charges. They could get me to pay for that and I gladly would.</li><li>A new phone is a fair chunk of change, particularly when I wouldn’t be unhappy with mine if it were better supported. It’s hard for me to trash a good phone to get another good phone. And the new phone will be more than this one was, presumably because they add capacity for things. But I’d be fine as I am. By pushing me back into the market, I’m going to consider other manufacturers. And if I’m paying out then I’ll probably choose one of the other makes. I assume these short lifespans are to keep me buying, but it’s backfiring. I’d keep buying service and support for the one I have, if I could. If I’m buying new, anything could happen.</li><li>I’ll probably wait for the next iPhone. I don’t like how expensive they are. I don’t like the stupid proprietry socket. I still don’t approve of removing headphone sockets. Built into its purchase price is a whole bunch of stuff I will immediately disable. But I don’t like how stock Android is clearly watching me, despite all efforts to stop data being harvested and sent back to The Mothership. I’d probably put up with it if I didn’t have to replace the thing, but it’s enough to stop me buying another.</li><li>I loathe phone-maker bullshit.</li></ul></li><li>Also took my Mac to meet its maker, with 54 days of Applecare left. For a while the righthand speaker has had an irritating buzz. The repair, outside of Applecare, would be an amazing £575.</li><li>This also means my weeknotes will be written not published this week, as I can’t get Publii to work on my other Mac.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/2/" class="btn">Previous</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
