It’s small enough to sit on my desk so I can put albums on as I work. I had a portable turntable there already—one of those ones DJs use when cratediving—but it was noisy and not really hi-fi enough to listen to at close range.</li><li>Audio-Technica made a limited run for their anniversary and were pleased enough with the demand to put the Sound Burger back into production. It’s taken months and months, but this is why we all need tools that routinely check web-pages for updates (like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/update-scanner/">this one</a> for Firefox).</li><li>For now, I have one case stuffed mostly with old jazz records and a few other favourites. Most of my vinyl is still in crates waiting to be taken from the current (temporary) digs to the next (permanent) home, where they will enjoy pride of place. Which leads me onto…</li></ul></li><li>Now within one last step of owning that permanent home. As in, it could happen within days. I was starting to feel I’d be a tenant for ever. Turns out all I needed to do was leave my home town and go somewhere I could be a gentrifier, not gentrifiee. Do I feel good about that? Not particularly. Am I looking forward to leaving shitty tenantsville limbo? Absolutely.</li><li>Work stuff has been busy this week; probably will be next week too.<ul><li>Stuff got done at both extremes. At the extroverted, social end: orchestrating research workshops. At the the introverted, reflective end: the torture of hunting for ideas. Sometimes they appear quickly, but you still have to keep looking in case you’ve just fallen for the first one you found. So I find having an idea really means finding 10-15 ideas and whittling them down, while being careful not to blend them into a grey average.</li><li>Work that involves sitting comfortably takes more recuperation than the rest.</li></ul></li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0026/">Weeknote 0026</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-30T18:00">30 June 2023</time></div></header><ul><li>Apart from in college and an ill-judgement during a lockdown, I’ve never bothered trying to be clean-shaven. Another lockdown ill-judgement was to try and grow a ‘proper’ beard, but the two sides of my face are yet to reach an agreement about whether it should be curly or dead straight. Attempt abandoned. These days, the grey hairs are more resistant to trimming than the others. My cat has white whiskers from her brown cheeks: I wonder if I would end up the same.</li><li>Another episode of The Grand Tour turned up on Amazon Prime, which I half-watched. It’s essentially based on the road-trip segment of the Top Gear format. But somehow its lost all its production values. The good camera work, the good edits, the good grading, all discarded. It looks like YouTubers made it, which makes me wonder why it’s still worth showing.</li><li>Lovely London lunch with a friend I’d not seen since the beforetimes. Covid prevented get-togethers for a while, but asynchronous communications continued. So it kind-of doesn’t <em>feel</em> like so much time has passed. I’m losing track of who I’m losing track of.</li></ul><h3 id="van-notes">Van notes</h3><p><em>[In which Mo builds a campervan]</em></p><ul><li>Post MOT, work continues. The big learning from this project, now in its third year, is how seemingly minor things cause massive delays. Getting stuff painted before assembly can in some cases result in weeks of waiting. If it were a full-time project and nothing else were happening, it’d be fine. But fitting painting coats around real life, while the other jobs stack up behind, can start to feel very static. Then occasionally there’s a huge leap forwards in the space of four hours.</li><li>Next, I have to figure out how to build the lightest possible kitchen.</li></ul></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0025/">Weeknote 0025</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-23T18:00">23 June 2023</time></div></header><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/26/saigon.jpeg" alt="Ho Chi Minh City" width="1200" height="514" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/26/responsive/saigon-xs.jpeg 300w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/26/responsive/saigon-sm.jpeg 480w, https://twil.momorgan.com/media/posts/26/responsive/saigon-md.jpeg 768w"></figure><p></p><ul><li>From Osaka, flew to Ho Chi Minh City. The first thing that’s striking is the traffic: there are road signals and markings, but herds of cars submerged in swarms of mopeds pay little attention. The next striking thing is the humidity, and the third is the wealth inequality. I felt conspicuous.</li><li>My sense is that Vietnam gets nicer the further from the cities you travel. Maybe I should have had a go at that 20 years ago. Still, it’s interesting to spend a day in a different city. Walked around some of the most famous sights. At the historic post office, three recent graduates stopped me for a conversation to practice their English. Sweet kids. I said some things that were on my mind about privilege.</li><li>Then took to the observation floor of the incongruous Bitexco Financial tower as the sun went down. Strange city, this. Both highly functional and deeply broken. I feel like almost everyone is being held down, somehow.</li><li>I fared better on the 12-hour flight back to Heathrow than I had on the way out via Hong Kong. I find the jetlag easier westward; I might even have slept a bit on the plane. When you’ve spent time somewhere like Japan, the amateurishness of Heathrow is stark; it took an age to disembark. Then a series of train-rides home; all seeming a bit half-arsed after the Shinkansen.</li><li>Two weeks is the amount of time I need to break from work. It takes ten days for my brain to stop trying to solve work problems, and the full fortnight for me to forget whatever it is I do. So I returned to my desk feeling fresher than I can remember.</li><li>Had the great pleasure of lecturing again for the Accelerate programme at the Judge Business School. I do a hot 90 on DIY brand-building for the benefit of startups and young ventures. I’d rejigged the deck slightly since the last time through, to take out the bits that always seem to drag. I might have cut too deep: it’s now a little ranty. But hopefully useful to people. I always get nice feedback from folks, so I hope they can make use of it all. And it keeps me sharp.</li><li>Instructed a solicitor to put together a will, which felt grown-up. I’m going to put in an annual reminder to update it. This first version is a functional answer to “what are we supposed to do with all Mo’s stupid stuff?”. Over the course of the coming year, I’d like to think more deeply about important people and what they might find sentimental, useful or funny to inherit.</li><li>Took the van in for MOT. I have found one of life’s great necessities: <a href="https://www.martekmotorservices.co.uk/">a honest garage</a>. I have used them for three years and I intend to keep returning no matter where I am living. This year the van sailed through, which I suppose means the work they did last year has held up. I should really buy a car, too.</li><li>Went to see Wes Anderson’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230388/">Asteroid City</a>; a film that’ll surely polarise. Many movies (maybe most) put their themes, characters and memorable moments into dialogue. Here, I sense Anderson is showing a story rather than telling it, and that will certainly polarise audiences. Loved it.</li></ul></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/page/2/" class="btn">Previous</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
