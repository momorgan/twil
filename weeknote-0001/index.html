It’s <a href="https://momorgan.com">me</a>. Hope you’re well.</p><p>##A longer introduction than I intended</p><p>In some form or another, I’ve been diarising for years. In 2000, I started posting to my site every day using a home-made content management system. It was blogging by the original loose definition; probably now you’d call it public journalling or something.</p><p>Eventually a public diary stopped being a good idea: as the web’s population grew I found myself needing to censor more, which increased the drag. I packed it in after six years or so. Revisited it a couple of times but by then social media was in full swing, so having some random little diary didn’t have its original social benefits.</p><p>More recently I ran a <a href="https://blast.red">newsletter</a> for three years: something I’d wanted to commit some effort to for a while. Although it really is a lot of effort. I can see why people try and monetise it, although that was never of much interest to me.</p><p>After that, I fired up a new blog, <a href="https://doing.digital">doing.digital</a>, focussing specifically on digital-era human behaviours. Thinking about this stuff is basically my day-job and so the blog has a formal-ish style. Not quite right for rough notes and underbaked reflections.</p><p>That said, I always enjoyed the discipline of getting stuff down on a regular schedule, which led me to firing up this little site so I can record and publish some <a href="https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html">weeknotes</a> of sorts.</p><p>There’s a couple of conventions I’ll have to bend. Weeknotes are method of team communication, usually with a known audience. My work environment hasn’t adopted this style yet and I don’t want to wait for that kind of change to come about. I’ve wasted too much of my life waiting for cultural shifts when I should’ve just cracked on. So I’m using the rough format just to structure some blog posts, by the early definition.</p><p>Second, there are plenty of things I do in my working week that shouldn’t be public, for reasons I’m sure are the same in everyone’s job. There will be omissions and obfuscations—perhaps enough just to remind me what it was, but not enough for anyone else—and leave it at that.</p><p>That’s enough up-front waffle. New year, new schedule. Let’s see how this goes.</p><hr><footer><div class="post__tag-share"></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
