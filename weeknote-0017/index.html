Both lift up to reveal… (more about that another time). They’ve been designed to be as light as possible. The downside is they’re not standalone, like regular furniture: they can’t be sat upon until the’re completely installed.</li><li>This weekend I cleared most of the tasks that need to be done before the benches can be finished off, which feels like progress even though most of it is just fiddling about.</li><li>Related: sometimes slide decks come together easily, other times it’s a real struggle. This week I’ve been flip-flopping between <em>three</em> presentations that are all proving difficult to write.</li><li>A good day filming for <a href="https://hellolumino.com">Lumino</a> today. We have such a great community of talented and committed people, and I feel lucky every day. I said some vaguely coherent things on video, and looked gormless in stills. All in a day’s play.</li></ul><footer><div class="post__tag-share"></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
