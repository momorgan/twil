An intelligent person like you would think it’d be a useful convention to introduce. But, I can tell you categorically that you should not waste an iota of your consciousness trying to do this: it’ll never, ever work.</p><p>Agencies talk of innovation and ideas and creativity and the future, but are starkly conservative. That leads them to sell talent by the metre as opposed to by the value it could bring: it’s a model so flawed that, like democracy, it’s a frustration there’s nothing better that could be implemented in its place. Well, there <em>are</em> other models that would work in theory, but it never, ever, <em>ever</em> works for real because clients simply won’t buy it. The only way clients will agree to buy agency talent is by the metre, and that is the single biggest influence on the seemingly wacky behaviour of agency businesses.</p><p>All that leads to one thing: timesheets. The gold, what little there is, is in them there timesheets. In every agency I’ve ever worked, there is a near-constant collective monologue about job codes, traffic management and timesheets. This reaches a head at the end of the week, as timesheets need to be put in. Typically, this administrative task enters the pre-frontal cortex on Friday at about 4pm, and then begins the labourious task of trying to reconsile whatever it was you did over the last five days.</p><p>Timesheets are weirdly taxing because they demand a fidelity of recall that doesn’t suit the way we remember things. Our memories are connected to the feelings we had. It’s easier to recall how you felt about something than what you did about something. This is what makes human memory so fallable. Change the feeling: change the memory.</p><p>Anyway, that’s the crux of why agency people don’t keep weeknotes: it’s the switch of mental mode. Timesheets demand a mode of logical guesswork that requires us to suppress all thoughts of what went well, what we learned, what was fun or how valuable something was. Then mode-switching back to emotional recall is just as mentally expensive. So, agencies will never, ever keep weeknotes. Even if there were some internal drive for it, it wouldn’t stick. Unless someone could construct an AI that you could feed emotional memory in the form of weeknotes and it could map the effort or value back to the billings. Hashtag free idea.</p><p>This all ladders up to the power imbalance between agencies and clients, as almost everything about agencies ultimately does. Clients aren’t at <em>fault</em>, but they do have the casting vote in any decision. It means there’s a constant downward pressure on price while general fannying about on both sides increases the cost of service. The squeeze in the middle causes the enthusiasm for reconsiling working hours regardless of value. Perversely, if clients <em>insisted</em> on receiving weeknotes like they do for financial transparency, they’d benefit enormously. It would encourage the agency to balance its collective attention between the money charged and the value returned. Anyway, won’t happen, don’t even try.</p><p>Perhaps to disprove all this, I like putting in my timesheets. It keeps me honest. The cruelty is that the <em>work</em> gets done largely outside the periods of time in which my timesheets record. All too often I’ll spend an unhealthy proportion of the ‘working’ day staring blankly at a problem or fiddling in the margins. Then at 4am I’ll wake with a solid idea. Then I’ll have to reach for the laptop to capture it, trying to make up the time lost fannying around during the day before the idea sailed in.</p><p>I’m careful to make my timesheets <em>accurate</em>, but there’s accuracy and then there’s accuracy. They could not feasibly reflect both the fannying-around time and the real, valuable work because it was impossible to predict where and when the lightning would strike when whatever project was costed up. I’d love there to be a line-item in the proposal for ‘fiddling around writing fairly unsatisfying bullet points on a PowerPoint chart while waiting for the magic to happen’. But clients wouldn’t buy that level of honesty either.</p><p>If this were a snappy LinkedIn post, this last bit would be a rallying cry for rethinking the model. But I’ve not put this here with any expectation it’ll change. Rather, by recording it, I never have to think about it again.</p><p>Now, where was I?</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2023 <a href="https://momorgan.com">Mo Morgan</a>.
